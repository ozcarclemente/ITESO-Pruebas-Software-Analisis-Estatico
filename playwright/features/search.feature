Feature: Google Search
  As a user
  I want to search for "<Search>" on Google
  So that I can see the search results page

  Scenario Outline: Searching for content on Google
    Given I am on the Google homepage
    When I search for "<Search>"
    Then the results page title should start with "<Search>"

  Examples:
  | Search        |
  | Hello, world! |
  | Iteso         |
  | Amazon        |
